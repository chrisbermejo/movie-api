# Web Scraping API

This project utilizes web scraping techniques to create an API for accessing IMDb's advanced search functionality. With this API, users can search for movies or TV shows based on various criteria such as title, genre, rating, release date, and more. The backend of the API is built using JavaScript with Express.js and Cheerio for web scraping.

Additionally, the project includes a frontend built with React.js, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the API. Users can explore movie and TV show data retrieved from the API, and there is also a recreation of IMDb's homepage showcasing trailers and movies for each genre, all powered by the API.
